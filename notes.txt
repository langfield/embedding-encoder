Assorted notes from the development process.

# ISSUE: Multiprocessing hangs.  
This is most likely because of this documented quirk of multiprocessing.Queue:

Bear in mind that a process that has put items in a queue will wait before terminating until all the
buffered items are fed by the “feeder” thread to the underlying pipe. (The child process can call the
cancel_join_thread() method of the queue to avoid this behaviour.)

This means that whenever you use a queue you need to make sure that all items which have been
put on the queue will eventually be removed before the process is joined. Otherwise you cannot be
sure that processes which have put items on the queue will terminate. Remember also that
non-daemonic processes will be joined automatically.

Basically, you need to make sure you get() all the items from a Queue to guarantee that all the
processes which put something into that Queue will be able to exit.
